Permission in linux is easy:
There are two ways:
1. Symbolic mode
2. Binary or octal mode

There are three major permission:
read-r, write-w, execute-x.

chmod = changes the permission of the file like give execute permission 
chmod u=rwx "filename" = symbolic mode example
u = means owner or current user permission
g = group
o = other users

drw-r--r--
d means this is the directiry
rw- means the owner's permission
r-- group permission
r-- other user's permission

chmod go-wx test.sh = removes the write and execute permission to the group and all other members
chmod u-x test.sh

binary mode
r - 4
w - 2
x - 1

chmod 744 "test.sh" means user has full permission, group and other users has only the read permission
chmod 765 "test.sh" means user has full permission, group has read, write and user has read, execute permission.

Directory permissions
chmod ugo=rwx learning/
chmod 644 learning/
chmod -R 777 learning/ = gives full permission to all files present in the learning dir using -R

To change the ownership for the file and directory
chown root "file name"

To change the grop ownership
groups "username" = list all the group the user belongs to
chgrp = to change the group ownership - confusion
chgrp root test.sh 

---------------------------------------------------
grep - use to find the particular content in the file
grep "pattern or string to search" "filename"

cat cl.txt | grep "pattern to search" = this is called piping(redirecting the result to other commands)

the symbol > will put the content into the file, It is not like pipe.

--------------------------------------------------------
locate -all "file_name"  = used to find the file by name. it searches the provided file name in the system.

locate -i "file_name" = removes the case-sensitive check
  
---------------------------------------------------------
find "directory_name" -type f or d -name "file_name" = search the file in the provided directory, also use -iname to remove case check.

find . -type f -perm 744 = display all the files having 744 level permission
